# Training Sodoku Using Reinforcement Learning Algorithms
This report presents the application of reinforcement learning (RL)
to solve the Sudoku 6x6 puzzle using three RL algorithms: Q-learning,
Monte Carlo, and SARSA. We compare the performance of these algo-
rithms in terms of success rate, total rewards, and training efficiency. The
results show the strengths and weaknesses of each algorithm in this con-
text, providing insights into their suitability for solving similar problems.
