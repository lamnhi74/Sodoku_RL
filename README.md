# Training Sodoku Using Reinforcement Learning Algorithms
This repository contains code and documentation for training an agent to solve 6x6 Sudoku puzzles using Reinforcement Learning (RL) algorithms such as Q-learning, SARSA, and Monte Carlo.

## Project Overview

Sudoku 6x6 is a number-placement puzzle where the objective is to fill a 6x6 grid with numbers 1-6, ensuring no number repeats in any row, column, or 2x3 subgrid.

In this project, we implemented the following RL algorithms:
- Q-learning
- SARSA
- Monte Carlo

The results are evaluated across different puzzle difficulties (easy, medium, hard).

## Results

The following results were obtained:
- SARSA performed best on more difficult Sudoku puzzles.
- Q-learning was effective on simpler puzzles but faced challenges with higher complexity.
- Monte Carlo took longer to converge but eventually achieved good results.
